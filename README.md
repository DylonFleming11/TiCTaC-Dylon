First project ever as a Web Developer! A Tic Tac Toe game where you play against your self. No AI included at the moment (will probably revist adding AI post bootcamp). Simply create a login, username and password, Sign in, find the new game button at the bottom and away you go! X will always be the first move on the board, you will also have control over placing the O. Once the game is over the board will disapear and you will see a victory message. The board will come back to you once you hit the name game button again!

Thanks for checking out my first ever APP as a Web Developer!
